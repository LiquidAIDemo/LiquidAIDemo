# Further development ideas

This document introduces the further development ideas for the energy optimizer -project. 

## More intelligent optimization for the components

- Keeping track of the temperatures of the water heater, sauna heater, jacuzzi as well as the fridge and freezer, and lowering or lifting the temperatures if needed.  
- Showing the electric car's battery percentages.
- Utilizing the electric car's battery. I.e. taking electricity from the battery into the house and recharging the electric car's battery when electricity prices are low.
- Informating the optimizer when the electric car will be used the next time. This enables more optimized charging of the electric car based on the electricity prices. 
- Optimizing the energy produced by the solar panels. Using the "free" electricity from the solar panels and calculating the savings. 

## Showing the carbon dioxide emissions

- Calculating how much carbon dioxide the household emits.
- Visualizing the carbon dioxide emissions. 
- Showing how much can be saved in carbon dioxide emissions with optimized energy consumption. 

## Showing what components contribute to the calculations

- Giving detailed information about which components contribute to the calculations of the total consumption.

## Price information in the main view

- Displaying the electricity price and the price of the consumed optimized electricity in the chart in the main view.  

## Showing hourly cost of electricity in the component views that are not optimized

- Displaying the prices of electricity and the electricity consumption on the component pages of the components that are not optimized.
